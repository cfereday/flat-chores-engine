# flat-chores-engine

## About

A toy project using [Clara rules](http://www.clara-rules.org/) to better understand them.

This is a flat chores rules engine. It has as a comparison a conditional version of the same program not using the rules.

The aim is to show scenarios when using a rules engine can help, and how it compares to straight forward conditionals.
The aim is also to explore when you shouldn't use an engine. 

## Usage

Running the tests will generate test sessions that fire the rules.
```
cd engine/

lein test
```
